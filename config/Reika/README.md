As part of the requirement for Reika's mod license, any time you make a change to Reika's mods,
you must add a line in the mod's "PackModifications.cfg" file.  This uses the in-game handbooks
to notify players of any changes made to the pack so they will know a change is intended.

The oregen alteration was noted as an example.
