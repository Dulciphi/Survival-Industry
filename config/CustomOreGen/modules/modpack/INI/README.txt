Recently, a new, advanced version of Sprocket has been made and released.  This new version of Sprocket does not support the classic one-option-to-a-line INI format, but instead has its own format which combines multiple settings for each option into one comma-separated line.

Because of the incompatibility between different Sprocket versions, and because of an effort in improving the oregen for this modpack, the classic Sprocket configs have been preserved in the "Classic" folder.  A new "Advanced" folder has been created to migrate the configurations to the new format without removing the originals.

Once all the new configurations are in place, the classic folder will go away, and the new folder will become the official configuration source for Survival Industry's oregen.
