# Survival-Industry-Configuration

Here are the configuration files that were changed for the
"Survival Industry Modpack Recipe."  You can find the forum
thread (and the links to all the required mods) at the following
URL:
* http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/mod-packs/2446203-modpack-recipe-survival-industry-a-progressive

This is meant to go in the main folder of Minecraft.

I placed it here so further changes could be tracked and discussed
by others who want a hand in the modpack's design.

If you are a mod author, and you do not want your mod's configuration
file held here, please let me know so I can remove it.
