[Survival Industry](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-survival-industry-rotarycraft-based-tech.112573/), by gerb82 and reteo, is a progressive sandbox challenge modpack designed to be difficult, but not _too_ difficult.

Your goals are to survive, automate, and go nuts. How you go about this is entirely up to you; there is a progression, but it is not absolute. If you manage to make it to the endgame, you have a number of mad science specialties to choose from (or collect).

The world is a tougher place. Hunger has been made more important. Animals will fight back, and villagers will defend their homes if you damage them. Fatigue has been added; you need to sleep... and sleep won't keep the monsters away, so shelter is now much more important. Seasons have been added, and animals and plants have life cycles. Ore is much harder to locate, and you can't mine it all right away.

As for the monsters, they are the same as they always were, but they're not. They're more alert. More flexible. And they work together. Many have new abilities. And nighttime means horde mode... especially during the dreaded Blood Moon.

But as hard as things might get, remember, it's not all against you. Flesh wounds heal quickly. Food can be found everywhere, and can be made into a vast array of nutritious recipes. Greenhouses can be constructed to deal with the seasons. And alternatives to mob drops are found in nature, if you take the time to explore. Flowers can indicate where which ores are in the world, and when you find a vein, you can get stacks of ore from it, which can eventually be multiplied many times over. The more you mine, fight, or farm, the more effective you become. And a huge array of machinery is available to do your bidding, as well as energy sources ranging from a simple redstone-powered engine, all the way up to the tokamak reactor, the single largest source of power in all of modded minecraft!

The world is now a much more challenging place. But you're up to the challenge. And once you get started, you're more than capable of establishing your own Survival Industry.
