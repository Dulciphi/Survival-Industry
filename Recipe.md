**Survival Industry** is a *sandbox challenge tech pack*, meaning that it is a sandbox game (not using Hardcore Quest Mods) with technical mods that is designed to be more challenging than usual, while attempting to avoid the clich√©s currently in force in the modpack landscape.

* Monsters are more aware, more varied, and more cooperative. They can spawn in groups, travel in groups, and work in groups.
* You will need to sleep; staying awake for more than two days can take its toll on you. And sleeping doesn't prevent monsters from spawning; while you sleep, the world will continue to go on, even if at a faster rate. If you're not inside shelter, you can expect to be killed.
* Hunger is more than merely a mechanic; you need to eat to survive. Food is less filling, and you need to eat more than one thing. The only hope of keeping yourself fed enough to progress is to take advantage of advanced recipes that provide significant increases to your hunger satisfaction; eating crops will suffice, but not for long.
* Mining is a much bigger challenge. The mining progression has six stages, from wood to diamond, rather than the three present in vanilla. Ores are not sprinkled about, but concentrated in veins. You will have to look for them; they won't just be where you mine.
* Technology is a mental challenge. This isn't a redstone flux pack; you will need to learn a simplified form of mechanical (and eventually nuclear) engineering to progress through to the endgame.

However, with all these challenges, you are not without your own advantages.

* You are not required to fight the monsters right away; items normally collected from mobs can be found or crafted using alternative materials collected from nature. And when you need to fight, you will have stronger weapons, as well as the ability to carry and use a shield to take hits for you. You also can take a small amount of temporary damage, which can quickly heal back up without affecting you at all.
* You are given a sleeping bag to begin the game, and with several ways to collect and make wool (or its closest equivalent), you should quickly be able to make a bed for yourself. And as long as you have shelter, nothing can get to you.
* Wild gardens are plentiful, and spawn all over the place. The number of crops are legion, both in farmable form, and in tree-grown form. You can mutate crops to make seeds you might not otherwise have, and can strengthen crops to always get the maximum yield. And there's a plethora of advanced recipes to keep you fed and satisfied.
* Flowers spawn to indicate the location of key ores (and using bone meal can give hints to the ores' depth), and massive caves sometimes spawn in the earth that you can explore to find exposed veins of ore. Mining a single vein can result in multiple stacks of ore once you've exhausted it.  And you won't be able to reach the end without actually making it to the end, as all End Portals have eroded down into cobblestone.
* The engineering knowledge required is a heavily-simplified form of real-world engineering skills; if you know how to multiply and divide using a calculator, you should have all the skills necessary to learn the system.  And the technology has no limits. Once you reach the minimum requirements, increasing shaft speed will always increase the speed of the machines attached to it (except in the case of heat generation, but that just requires an increase in power). There are machines that can do just about everything, from farming, to mining, to base construction, to base defense. Power ranges from the minuscule DC Electric Engine to the immense output of a nuclear fusion reactor. You can tweak your genes, or convert useless junk into priceless materials. You can automate just about anything.
* And as for the End... you can now make your very own End Portal once you advance far enough.  Indistinguishable from magic, indeed.

So grab your sleeping bag, make your stone tools, and begin your journey. Because you're up to the challenge. And once you get started, you're more than capable of establishing your very own... Survival Industry. 

# Modpack Design

This modpack operates under a number of important rules.

1. Maintain a good balance between hardcore and casual gameplay.  "Challenge" should be an accurate description.
2. Provide the player with several tiers of play, as a way to encourage the player to expand their abilities and improve themselves without jumping straight to the endgame.
3. Provide sufficient rewards at the endgame to make the challenge worth the effort.
4. Limit the mods to provide one block per function.  This isn't always strictly adhered to, but it is close enough to avoid the "Kitchen Sink Pack" designation.
5. Avoid the mainstream mods.  This is also a hit-or-miss proposition, but unlike most modpacks, this is not your usual "Redstone Flux" pack with Thermal Expansion, EnderIO, and MineFactory Reloaded.  The main tech mods are centered around RotaryCraft, and all power generation not provided by RotaryCraft is disabled for this pack.

The modpack has five tiers of play, each gated behind a specific material.  Unlike most modpacks, these materials are not determined by the random number generator; they are behind your ability to build youself and your base to the point that the material can be collected and/or made.

To this end, I provide this recipe, so that other people who want to make modpacks can have an idea as to what they need to consider when designing a pack.

First, before I even download any mods, I set a folder system to place them in.  This way, I can keep the downloaded mods split into their necessary categories.  This allows me to switch mods when I want to replace one mechanic with another similar mechanic.

The folders used in this pack are:

* Prerequisites
* Game-Wide & Agrarian Age
  * Game Balance Mods (Containing "Challenges" and "Mitigation" folders)
  * Ore Mods
  * Meta Mods 
  * Cosmetic Mods
  * User Interface Mods (Containing "Server" and "Client" folders)
* Industrial Age
  * Railway
  * Redstone Flux
  * Shaft Power
* Mad Science
* Ender Tech
* The End

I'll now go through the different folders as sections to explain the different mods used.

# Prerequisites

This contains all the prerequisite mods; those mods that are needed for other mods to work.  Obviously, You want to keep them separate, since they may be required for mods in more than one category.  An example would be DragonAPI for RotaryCraft, ElectriCraft, and ReactorCraft (In the Industrial Age's "Shaft Power" folder, and Expanded Redstone in the "Game-Wide & Agrarian Age/Game Balance/Mitigation" folder)  I won't bother listing the mods, since they can sometimes change based on who takes over what project, and whether a new companion mod is used.

# Game-Wide & Agrarian Age

These mods are designed to be used from the very beginning of the game.  Oftentimes, they will be used throughout the entire game, so while I can refer to them as "Agrarian Age" mods, to identify the game's stage in which they are most useful, they are going to be relevent even after moving onto other stages in the game.

## Game Balance Mods

These mods are essentially split into two categories: Challenges, or mods that increase the difficulty of the game, and Mitigation, or mods that provide ways to make the challenges easier to handle.

### Challenges

We begin with the challenges.  These challenges are themselves split into four categories: Game mechanics, Hunger and Health, Mob Tweaks, and Mining.

#### Game Mechanics

In the game mechanics are three mods.

Harder Wildlife is a mod that adds a lot of things to the game.  Animals will breed on their own, age, and die.  Trees will eventually die, their trunks will become compost (which you can collect), which will then become grass blocks, and their saplings will auto-plant.  Seasons exist in the game, and the world temperature will rise and fall as dictated by the time of the year (which is 128 minecraft days by default, with 32 days for each season).  The temperature change will not be as drastic to plants and machines when indoors.

Random Things actually provides a lot of features, but for the challenges, you can't get more challenging than the Blood Moon.  This is an event that has, by default, a 5% chance of happening each night.  During the blood moon, all lights take on a red tint, the sky turns completely black, the moon is red (duh), there is a black fog obscuring vision, and mobs will spawn in greater numbers, and much more closely to you (within 3 blocks if there is a spawn point)... with an increased chance of being on the attack (rather than just wandering around).

By default, hostile mobs are easy to avoid with a bed.  Go to sleep before it's dark enough to spawn hostile mobs, and you will skip right to the morning, without a single hostile mob in sight.  With Somnia, you can still sleep through the night, but instead of jumping to morning, time just passes by much more quickly.  Processes will still continue while you sleep, mobs will still spawn and roam, and if they can reach you, they will attack you in your bed.  This means that you will need to make a shelter before you sleep, in order to make sure you're protected while sleeping.

#### Hunger & Health

In vanilla minecraft, food is little more than a speedbump.  Collect a stack of steaks, and you're good for a long, long while.  However, in this pack, three mods will stop this mechanic from being so easily ignored.

Hunger in Peace closes the Peaceful Mode loophole.  If you go to peaceful mode, monsters will still despawn, but you will not regenerate like vanilla, and your hunger will continue to tick away until it is gone.  In essence, Peaceful Mode is no longer the overpowered "panic button" it used to be, even though it's still the panic button option for dealing with hostile mobs.

Hunger Overhaul makes complex recipes more worthwhile.  Simple ingredients provide only the most minimum hunger satisfaction in the game.  To get more hunger and saturation with each bite, you need to combine those ingredients into larger recipes.  You can survive on nothing but crops, mind you, but there will be almost no saturation, which means you'll become hungry again in short order.  This mod also lengthens the crop growth time, and reduces the effectiveness of bonemeal on crop growth.  When combined with harder wildlife's seasons, farming becomes a very important mechanic that you can't afford to put off.

Spice of Life closes the "one-food" loophole.  Each time you eat the same food, it will be less satisfying, until you reach a point where it doesn't do any good.  You need to mix up your food, making different recipes in order to make sure the food is having its maximum effect.  There is the paper lunch bag, and the iron lunch box that can hold food in its maximum forms (and you can use them to collect maximum-effect foods from any storage).

#### Mob Tweaks

Mobs are pretty predictable, which means they're not very threatening.  Zombies can be guaranteed to only hurt you when in range, and can be counted on to take the shortest safe path to reach you.  Skeletons will shoot arrows.  Creepers make no sound, except when they're about to blow, and that's pretty much all they do.  Spiders are pretty much 1-block-high climbing zombies.  They only have one effect: take damage when they hit.  Witches and cave spiders are an exception to this, in that they can poison you, but that's the only variation in a pretty straightforward opposition.

And if they're not actively chasing you, they are completely random.

Four mods changes all this.  Taken together, these mods provide what is known as "Emergent AI," in which the end result of all these different mods is that mobs move in ways that can seem intelligent, almost conscious, and with a much more effective end result.

Zombie Awareness is the first part of this quartet.  With Zombie Awareness, several mob types (not just zombies) will wander in the direction of lights, sounds, and the smell of a wounded player (signified by splotches of blood on the ground dropped by the player).  This effect only happens when the mobs are in "wander mode," in which they are not actively pursuing or targeting a player.  Because of this awareness, mobs will generally congregate over time to significant areas.  Can you say "horde mode?"

Special AI is the second part of this quartet.  This allows mobs to spawn with various behavior patterns, beyond the same old "target player and try to hit them".  Some mobs will suddenly charge at the player at high speed.  Some can jump toward the player.  The shaman can heal all hostile mobs in his area.  The thrower can pick up other hostile mobs and throw them at you (or pick you up and throw you in the direction of a group of hostile mobs).  There's even one type of mob that will wear a spawner on its head; it has a lot of hitpoints, and can spawn other mobs in the dark.  Together with a shaman, these mobs can give you a very bad day... especially since they don't burn up in the sun.  Sometimes, zombies will carry bows and skeletons will use their hands... or even a weapon.

Some behaviors also exist for all mobs, regardless of their individual behavior patterns.  mobs that are taking damage will "call for help," attracting other mobs in the area to where they are.  Some will look for a mountable creature to ride, while others are rideable.  A passive griefing behavior exists, in that all hostile mobs will, when not actively targeting a player (in "wander mode"), break things like doors, beds, and light sources (and remember, they're attracted to light sources in wander mode).  In the case of creepers, they'll explode next to anything they want to grief.

The behaviors do not just affect hostile mobs.  Passive creatures will defend themselves and their pack when attacked, similar to the way Zombie Pigmen act.  Villagers will grow to dislike players who damage their homes, and eventually attack the player if they do enough damage.

Behaviors are only one part of this.  Once the mobs have wandered to where you are and actually found you, they can sometimes have other effects beyond just hitting.  Hungry mobs will take items from your inventory.  Flaming mobs can set you on fire, and do not burn in the sun (although they take damage from water).  Plague mobs can poison you (in the case of archers, from a distance).  Tough mobs can take a lot of damage, and brutal mobs do a lot of damage.

Creepers in particular come in various flavors, including fire, lightning, dirt, gravel, ender, gravity, and even doom and death varieties.

If that's not enough, creepers also have a new mechanic of their own: they stalk.  They will follow you until you turn enough for them to be seen on the screen.  It is then when they'll actually explode.  If you think this is a good thing, let me ask you: how many creepers are following you right now?  NO, DON'T LOOK... oooh, better luck next time.

In the end, you have a horde of mobs that will find you based on your activity, whether it's the light of your torches or the sound of your digging.  They will have different roles, including tank, healer, DPS, and even enemy control (throwers and "fishermen), which means they can work together to kill you.  And when they hit, they can have different status effects, making you even less likely to survive.

Keep in mind that at this point, they're hard, but not impossible.  The "call for help" behavior can be used in a trap to get all the mobs trapped (especially if the trap is a mob grinder).  Mobs will randomly grief things, but this doesn't happen all the time.  Staying under shelter at night means you will not likely encounter anything you can't handle.

If you're a hardcore gamer, and this isn't enough to make you happy, you can always add in "Mutant Creatures" and "Infernal Mobs" for the extra-hard mobs to face... or even mods like Mo'Creatures or Lycanite's Mobs for a real variety.

#### Mining

The mining is considered a challenge, because the only worldgen mod installed, Custom Ore Generation: First Revival, is designed to rearrange ore to be placed in discrete formations, rather than sprinkled everywhere.  This means that ore cannot be easily found simply by digging until you see little clusters; you will have to actively look for the ore you want to mine.

In addition to this, the Survival Industry core mod, a custom mod, is installed, which expands the mining progression by a significant amount.  Instead of stone, iron, and diamond, you have to mine (and make pickaxes) in this order: stone, copper, tin (to make bronze), iron (to make steel), and diamond.  So, not only do you need to find the ores, you need to mine them in a specific order before you're ready to begin making machines.

### Mitigation

With all this challenge, this game has crossed the threshold into hardcore.  Now, we need to make sure we cross that threshold back into the vicinity of simply "challenging."  Mitigating factors come in several forms: Crafting, Farming, Mechanics, Redstone, Storage, and Worldgen.  There's also a crossover from the Challenges, as the mod has both challenging and mitigating features.

#### Crossover from Challenges

The Random Things mod also has mechanics and items that can fit in the mitigations category.  There is an increased leaf decay and the ability to use spectre materials to make various things, including spectre glass which you can walk on, but mobs fall through, and the spectre key, which creates a 1-chunk-large personal dimension for you to set up a base, a portal nexus, or just a panic room to recover in.

#### Crafting

Several mods include various craftable items that can help mitigate the risk.

OpenBlocks is a grab bag of items that can make things easier.  XP drains and showers allow you to store your experience somewhere where you won't lose it when you die.  This can be valuable when dealing with death.  There is a sleeping bag, which is an important early-game tool to have to keep your fatigue from going too far.  And a multiblock portable tank can be useful in storing fluids you will occasionally need to dip into with a bucket from time to time.

OpenBlocks also removes the risk of your items being lost on your death if you are not able to get back to them in time.  OpenBlocks provides a grave where all your items are stored.  Once you break the grave (in essence, "robbing your own grave), all your items are dropped.

Small Boats provides three alternatives to the basic rowboat you can make as part of the basic vanilla gameplay.  The first level is the punt, which is a larger rowboat with a single sail, the second is a whitehall, which is more along the lines of a full sailboat, and a Hoy is a much larger boat that can optionally carry cannon.  These boats allow the player to explore the world without worrying about the boat falling apart the moment it hits a squid or lily pad.

Steve's Workshop provides the work table.  This table can have up to four modules, whether they're crafting tables or furnaces.  It also extends the efficiency of coal, as the fuel use is twice the time of a vanilla furnace.  Once you have the ability to use a friction heater, this table will no longer be as useful for smelting, but with four crafting tables, you can make some pretty complex things without losing place in parent recipes.

The Vegan Option is a way of limiting your interaction with mobs.  It provides alternatives to just about every mob drop, short of the dragon egg or the nether star, using vanilla worldgen.  You will need to explore the world for this to be useful.

Because of the expanded mining progression, iron will not be available before you need to farm, and farming is the first thing you need to do after establishing your sleeping space.  To mitigate this issue, the wooden buckets mod has been added to the pack.  This mod allows you to use a wooden bucket to carry water where you want to place it.

Speaking of the mining progression, there is a singular lack of mention of an alloying mechanic so far, which is important for making bronze, which is required before machines can be made.

Part of the Survival Industry core mod is a mechanic called "Backyard Metalcasting," in which ores are smelted and alloyed in the vanilla furnace using a clay crucible.  Crucibles are made using a block of clay and a block of sand, and then the formed crucible is fired in the furnace to make a finished crucible.  A crucible can hold two ingots of different metals for alloying, or one block of ore for smelting (smelting ore directly in the furnace has been disabled).  Once the filled crucible has been smelted, you then craft the glowing-hot crucible with a sand ingot mold (crafted using simply one block of sand) to make either one (in the case of ore smelting) or two (in the case of alloying) ingots of metal.  The sand mold is turned back into sand (broken to reveal the cooled ingots), and the crucible is not lost, so this mechanic is infinitely repeatable without the need for more materials (aside from the metals or ores).  However, keep in mind that filled crucibles cannot stack, so this alloying mechanic is mainly for early-game; anyone wanting larger-scale alloying should look elsewhere.

"Elsewhere," in this case being RotaryCraft; the RotaryCraft blast furnace can also alloy ores without the need for the crucible; in this case, you can alloy ores in bulk, and in the case of steel, smelting iron with coal coke and gunpowder (without the sand) will produce low-grade (think "Railcraft" or "Metallurgy") steel ingots with a chance of bonus ingots per batch.  With the sand, and you end up with Metallurgy's High-grade (HSLA) steel.

#### Farming

Because hunger has been boosted in this pack, it stands to reason that there should be an expansion of what's available to eat. The default foods might be enough to keep a player going, but it would take a long while to find enough different types of food in vanilla to satisfy "Spice of Life."  So having more variety would help mitigate the hunger challenge.  And since food's satisfaction value is significantly less than it is by default, we will also need foods that provide a large amount of satisfaction in spite of Hunger Overhaul.

To provide the variety of food needed to survive Spice of Life, we add Pam's HarvestCraft.  This mod contains a huge number of crops, and an even larger number of recipes for prepared dishes, some of which requires a large number of steps to complete.  The more steps required to complete a recipe, the higher its satisfaction value.  In this way, you can have a large number of highly-filling foods, even with Hunger Overhaul and Spice of Life.

Sometimes, however, it's not enough to simply have the crops available.  You need to have the crops on a regular basis, which means farming.

Hunger Overhaul does actually help in this regard; the seed-collection mechanic simply requires you to use a hoe on unwatered ground, and you can harvest crops from farmland without breaking them by right-clicking on them.  However, Pam's crops cannot be collected in this way.  All throughout the world, however, you can find various "wild gardens" that contain three random crops each.  With enough exploration, you can amass a good collection of food and crops to plant for your personal garden.

Now, the vanilla farming mechanic does provide a good yield, but it's slow and inefficient.  Because of Hunger Overhaul, crops take 4 times as long to mature, and bone meal and other fertilizers are less effective than in vanilla.  It sure would be nice to have a means of speeding up the harvest, right?  And what do you do if a specific recipe calls for a crop you were not able to find up to this point?

Enter AgriCraft.  AgriCraft is a mod that allows crop mutation, which can improve the growth speed, strength (resistance to weeds), and yield of crops.  A fully-developed seed can grow very quickly, and always provides a yield of 4.

The other main feature of AgriCraft is "crossbreeding."  By crossbreeding two crops (putting two crops on each side of a "crosscrop" in the middle with the right soil), you can end up with a third crop.  With the right pair of crops, you can have the seed to crops you hadn't been able to locate yet.  This can help you finish filling out your garden.

There is also the weed mechanic.  However. weeds are a mechanic that can be irritating, and so are turned off in this modpack.  Additionally, irrigation is turned off because it can override the growth of vanilla crops, removing the challenges provided by Hunger Overhaul.

#### Mechanics

With all the difficulties provided, it might help to have some game mechanics to counterbalance them, right?  Otherwide, we'll just have a hardcore pack.

By default, you do not have a way to sleep.  Sheep will mob you if you hurt one.  Starting Inventory mitigates the first night by providing you a sleeping bag from OpenBlocks to sleep.  This sleeping bag won't change your spawn, though, so making a bed will still be important to long-term survival, but the sleeping bag is a way to reset the fatigue timer.

Harvesting trees can be a hassle.  So, Treecapitator has been added to the pack to simplify the tree cutting mechanic.  However, it would then make the early-game too easy, since wood is an important item.  Thus, Treecapitator is configured to only work with higher-level axes, meaning that you will have to advance to steel before you're ready to chop down whole trees.

The crafting table mechanic is pretty basic.  Nine slots to craft things in.  However, it would be nice to have a way to rotate the recipe in the table (perhaps you put things in the wrong way), or balance the materials on the table (make it so all placed materials are rearranged to have even amounts), or maybe just a quick way to clear the table without leaving it and dropping everything on the ground.  Crafting Tweaks adds three buttons that do just the above, making the crafting table just a little easier to work with.

The anvil is also pretty basic.  Two slots, one for your tool, and one for a magic book.  That's good for most uses, but what else can we do with this that might help your tools?  Enter ToolUtilities.  This mod provides recipes for the anvil that can provide 1x3 mining, 3x3 mining, and area of effect attacking for weapons.

Speaking of mining, there is also the fact that anything interrupting your effort to mine something will mean you have to start all over again.  Against cobblestone, this isn't a big deal, but what about obsidian?  There you are, mining a block of obsidian, and you get accosted by a group of mods.  You dispatch them quickly and return to your task, but it's too late... you need to start all over.

MultiMine is a mod that mitigates this problem, by making a block wait before slowly repairing itself when left alone.  That way, the busy player can defend themselves, and then pick up where they left off once they're back to that block of obsidian.  And if more than one player mines the block, it will mine faster!

Finally, you're going to be taking a lot of damage over the course of the game, it would be nice if you can be forgiven for stupid stuff, right?  This is where we turn to Natural Absorption.  This mod provides an absorption health bar of two hearts (four damage) that will regenerate if you don't take any more damage, similar to how shields in games like Halo and Borderlands work.  It won't block anything major, but it is enough to keep you alive if you're down to half a heart in your main bar, and you fall one block too far, or you accidentally bump into a cactus.

#### Redstone

While technology is reserved for the industrial stage, there's no reason that crude machines can't be used in the agrarian age; in the real world, basic wooden machines existed well before the invention of self-powering devices.  So, we add redstone technology to the Agrarian age.

First, there's a lot of logic that takes up way too much space by default.  For example, a simple toggle takes a 6x6x3 area.  Also, redstone paths are nothing more than sprinkling poweder onto the ground in paths.  Is this really what we want to use as a signal mechanic?

No, not really.  Not when Project:Red does it better.  Project:Red includes a large collection of logic gates that can be used in place of massive redstone-and-smoothstone structures.  It also provides redstone wires that can be placed on the ground, along walls, or even along the ceiling.

Expanded Redstone is also in the pack, mainly as a way to expand world interaction.  Block placers, block breakers, configurable redstone clocks, several sensors, line-of-sight wireless redstone, and redstone math devices are a part of what this mod offers, and it expands what redstone can do in the physical world.

Originally, this pack had Tinker's Construct.  Since then, the mod has been removed, since it is no longer supported.  One player had requested a replacement for the Tinker's Mechworks igniter, so it has been added.

#### Storage

The lowly chest can be useful, but sometimes, it can be a hassle to deal with.  It won't open if the lid is obstructed.  It can't be placed next to a double-chest.  This can make some unpleasant space issues in storage rooms, since you'll have a lot of empty space with nothing to put in it.  And chests can hold a limited number of stacks of items, which can be frustrating if all those stacks are the same item.  And let's not forget how messy chests can get over the course of play.  To sort this whole mess out, we're gonna need a few things.

First of all, larger chests would be nice.  And then, it would be nice if they opened in a different direction than just up.  And having a cheap storage multiblock would also help.  Better storage provides all this.

With reinforced chests, you can apply other materials to a recipe to make the chest larger on the inside, still able to be doubled, and as a bonus, resistant to explosions.  Additionally, the reinforced chests can be locked against player entry, with enchantments that can make the locks harder to pick (or keys more effective against unrelated locks).

Then there's the chest's vertical brother, the locker.  With lockers, the door is on the front, rather than the top, and they can be doubled and reinforced as well.  And, unlike the vanilla chest, the base locker can be placed immediately next to, and above or below, a double-tall locker, and even embossed into a wall, allowing you to maximize your storage space, and your walkspace as well.

The crate is the randomized multiblock version of the chest.  Each crate holds a small amount of stacks, but they are cheap, and can be made into a larger multiblock, meaning their storage spaces are added together.  Unlike chests, however, the crate's placement of items in the slots are randomized every time you look inside the crate.  There are also no pages to look through; if you don't see something in the UI, then you need to close the UI, right-click the multiblock again, and hope that your intended item is present.  As such, the crate is best when used in small sizes.

Sometimes, when dealing with a single item in large amounts (e.g. Cobblestone), you want to have a single storage space that is larger than one stack, without all the extra slots to waste your time.  Factorization introduced the barrel, but I really don't want all the extra stuff that mod provides.  As such, I chose to use ProfMobius's JABBA mod (Just Another Better Barrel Attempt).  This mod provides a barrel that can hold 64 stacks of any material, but only holds that one material.  This makes storage and filtering so much easier.

However, the barrel takes a whole block of space for just one item.  And while this is justified for the likes of cobblestone, it does not work for smaller-ticket items like rotten flesh, bonemeal, or sand, and eventually, ingots and blocks of metal.  Additionally, the barrel requires quite a bit of wood, including a wood slab, a chest, and seven log blocks.  This is a lot of wood (just over a half-stack of planks for just one barrel), and can be rather difficult to come by in the early game before automated wood collection, or treecapitator-enabled axes become available.

So, in addition to JABBA, Storage Drawers are also included in the pack.  These drawers provide support for multiple barrels in the same space.  They don't contain as much, but they don't need to, and they're much cheaper than making barrels for things that don't need that much storage space in the first place... and they help conserve space in the starting player's likely shack-sized first base.  Additionally, I've added forestry compatibility to the drawers to make use of the woods that Forestry provides.  If you use other mods that provide different trees, it's possible that Storage Drawers includes addons for those mods as well.

#### Worldgen

I try to avoid worldgen, because Custom Ore Generation already takes up a lot of performance every time the world generates new chunks for the player.  This can slow down a game significantly (especially at the beginning), so I do my best not to add new worldgen unless it adds something very specific.

There is one example that I do include, mainly because it's relatively simple, and it mitigates the problem of finding ores.  This mod is the Ore Flowers mod, and its sole purpose is to coordinate with Custom Ore Generation to spawn flowers within approximately 30 blocks (horizontally) of an ore vein.  This can help the prospecting player to find the desired ores without just randomly casting about with a tunnel.

Another additional feature added to the game to assist in finding ores are caverns.  This is actually a configuration for the Custom Ore Generation mod, but what it does is make massive caverns that can be explored to find ore veins; vanilla caves are generally small, and can easily miss veins.  Ravines are larger, but narrow enough that they can also miss veins.  Caverns, on the other hand, are much larger than caves and wider than ravines, and can intercept veins much more frequently.  It does require some casting about to find such a cavern, but once in a while, one can break the surface, allowing a player to enter without having to dig one block.  Keep in mind that a lot of torches will be required to light these caverns, however; they easily will require multiple torches just to light everything from one side to the other.

## Ore Mods

While Custom Ore Generation is used to place ores, it doesn't actually add any to the game.  While ElectriCraft provides copper and tin, it does not provide bronze, nor provide the tools, weapon, and armor that is needed to complete the mining progression.

To this end, Metallurgy is employed.  Metallurgy includes the ores, metals, and alloys that can complete the mining progression, and provide armor and tools for each of the metals it supports.

Also, for those players who can make it to the end, Nether Ores can provide additional resources to a player; ores mined in the Nether tend to be more dense, and therefore, yield more ingots than the overworld ores can manage.  This is especially the case if the ores are first processed using the grinder or extractor.

## Meta Mods 

Several mods are included for the sake of the pack itself, and does not neatly fit into any one or two categories.

Default Options is a mod that allows a modpack to be updated *without changing a player's settings*.  This can be a boon for players who have personalized their minecraft experience, whether it's the light level of the game or the fact that they use tab for the inventory screen instead of E.  At the same time, if the settings have not been set yet (meaning that the pack is being installed for the first time), the pack will install with the settings custom-tuned to the pack itself.

Java 8 checker simply causes the game to crash if the player is not playing the game with Java 8; there is simply no reason for using an insecure, unpatched version of Java.  And since most launchers will allow you to choose which version of Java to run, this should not hinder people who need an older version of Java for different reasons.

MineTweaker and Mod Tweaker are responsible for most of the melding of the mods, as well as the use of gating materials to prevent early use of the "Mad Science" and "Ender Tech" mods.  It alters WAILA Harvestability to show the mining level of ores, it is responsible for the chisel-based overhaul of ztones.  It is also what prevents non-RotaryCraft generators from being craftable, or even visible in NEI.  Simply put, these two mods are just as important to the pack's cohesion as the Survival Industry core mod is.

Speaking of which, the Survival Industry core mod is another key mod; it controls material and block properties, it has the ability to create custom materials, tools, items, and blocks, and includes a new alloying mechanic that does not even require machines or special ore processing.  It also has some interaction with DragonAPI, so that RotaryCraft-based packs can assign alloying recipes to the blast furnace.  This mod is currently custom-made for Survival Industry, but JeffPeng plans to make it more generalized for others to use.  This is the foundation of the mining progression and the early-game alloying processes.

By default, zombies can sometimes drop iron ingots and redstone, and everyone knows that zombie pigmen can drop gold nuggets.  These can short-circuit the progression, so the Mob Properties mod was included to prevent those materials from being dropped.

Finally, the game is not always stable; crashes do happen.  So, when they do happen, it's useful to have a good log of the game's events prior to the breakdown.  For this reason, OpenEye was included in the pack; if the game crashes while you're playing, then the next time the game loads up, it will report the conditions of the crash, and the events leading up to it, to a server, with plenty of information to identify the mod that's responsible, which mods are included in the issue, and what all mods are installed at the time of the crash.

## Cosmetic Mods

These mods are mostly cosmetic, although some provide additional mechanics that can be useful.  But, for the most part, these mods are here because they allow a player to decorate their base to be as garish or as tasteful as they desire.

This is basically the sole purpose of the DecoCraft mod; this mod makes a decobench that, when fed clay and colored dyes (rose red, cactus green, and lapis lazuli), it will allow the player to make anything they want, from clocks and chairs to chandeliers and a grand piano.  These objects do not need to be placed based on block borders, either.  They can be placed in several angles for the best view.  And things like the beds and light sources actually perform their intended purposes as well.

Garden Stuff is another strictly-decorative mod.  It provides ways to plant multiple flowers in a single block, thereby allowing more decoration in less space.  Additionally, full-size flowerpots can be made that can have multiple flowers planted within.

Chisel is another pure decorative mod designed to give blocks fancy carvings that might not otherwise be possible.  From bricks, to tiles, to a multiblock tile pattern that can expand to the size of an entire wall, this mod can expand the decoration options immensely.  A custom mod for this pack is "si.flintchisel," a mod that simply adds an additional chisel; a weak one (64 uses) made from flint.  This will allow chiseling at an early-game stage, before iron is available.

And then there's Ztones.  The blocks it provides are very fancy, and can be used in many ways to really pull of a desired look, whether you're looking to make a pretty castle or a dark fortress of dooooooom.  I usually include a mod to make Ztones chiselable, so that I won't need to worry about the more expensive ztone blocks; they will all be made the same way.  My preference is Chizzle Z-Tizzle, a script for Minetweaker, which can ensure that I don't need to add another mod, as I already have MineTweaker.

The other mods in this category leave the "strictly decorative" definition, and also include useful items, blocks, or mechanics.

BiblioCraft is one such mod.  It can form bookcases that can store any mod manuals you've crafted, reading desks that can also store books in a readable form, and also provides an atlas item, which can hold any number of vanilla maps, and selects between them as appropriate for the location you're in.  Additionally, custom books can be formed, including a "redstone book" which can be used in a bookcase to provide a redstone signal, and a working clock with chimes can be fashioned to keep you aware of the time of day.  The addition of BiblioWoods can allow BiblioCraft to make use of woods provided by non-vanilla wood mods, such as Forestry.

MrCrayfish's Furniture Mod is a grab-bag of furniture and appliances.  The furniture is mostly decorative, but the appliances are definitely functional, including a fire alarm, an oven for cooking, a refrigerator for storing food, and a computer with a printer that can copy enchanted books.

Carpenter's Blocks completely spans the gap between design and function.  Carpenter's blocks can be formed into any slope in any direction, and also contain options for doors, torches, safes, buttons, panels, and so on.  What really makes this mod functional is that all those items and blocks can have a block applied to them, and they adopt the properties of that block, such as blast resistance, lighting ability, and hardness.  Additionally, if using chiseled blocks, these blocks and items can adopt the chiseled textures.

## User Interface Mods

The big two interface mods included are pretty much something *everyone* uses.

Not Enough Items is a combination item list, recipe book, cheating tool, and world information system.  This mod is in just about every modpack, and for good reason; people use this to have access to recipes of various blocks, and to see what blocks are available when not in Creative mode.  This mod includes its two addons: NEI Plugins, and NEI Integration, also for good reason.

WAILA (What am I looking at?) is another major mod that few can afford to not use.  This is the mod that produces the tooltip at the top of the player's HUD that shows relevent information, such as a block name, what mod the item is from, or a mob's remaining hitpoints (among many, many other things).  Included with WAILA is Waila Plugins and Waila Harvestability.

Another major mod for information purposes is JourneyMap.  This is a real-time mapping UI that shows a minimap on the main screen, and has a more detailed view that you can access in-game.  This mod can even export the map to a web browser, allowing you to track the known world using a web browser while you play.  There is also a server mod that allows servers to limit what information the players will see in their Journeymaps, so there is no risk of players acting on forbidden knowledge.

Not all information is presented on the screen; sound is an often-overlooked source of information for the savvy player.  Two mods provide audio cues that help the player track things in the game.

The lighter sound mod is called "Sound Filters."  This mod simply adds two filters: an amplification filter that reduces the sound's amplitude and quality with distance (or blocks between the source and the player), and a reverberation simulator that makes caves sound like actual caves.

The larger sound mod is called "MAtmos."  This mod has a huge collection of detectors to determine what plays, including the ability to detect the time of day, what blocks are in the player's vicinity, what the weather is like, whether the player is high in the air, at ground level, whether the player is near an ocean biome, whether the player is near a source of laval, and whether the player is indoors, outdoors, or close enough to not matter.  All this is factored into the sounds that MAtmos plays, in order to set an atmosphere.

All this sound can influence the player without them realizing it; if the player hears lava; they're going to be more careful about digging.  If they hear crickets in the daytime, they know that night is coming, and it's time to set up a place to sleep, or return to the cabin.  If they hear water dripping indoors or underground, then they're either near a lake, or else it's a subtle sign that it's raining outside.  There's a lot of things a player can gather from using their ears, and this mod gives them that extra dimension of information to work with.

Dynamic Lights is another example of an information mod, although it might not seem so at first.  With this mod, a player can hold a torch and walk around.  As long as the torch is in their hand, or even on the ground, the area around the torch (and by extension, the player) will light up as if the torch was placed.  This guarantees that the player will be able to navigate through caves using their last torch.  It won't however, stop mobs from spawning, though, so be careful.

Outside of information display, there is also mods that change the user interface for gameplay purposes.

Inventory Tweaks is the most minor, but it is far from the least important change.  This mod allows the player to automatically sort what's in their inventory, or in whatever chest they have open at the moment.

Not Enoug Keys is an expansion on the controls configuration; it allows the player to export their keybindings, so that if something changes their settings, they can restore them exactly the way the player had them.

Right-click placement was an issue previously, just after removing Tinker's Construct from the recipe.  Two mods were chosen to fill in the holes left by that loss.

The first mod, Mine & Blade: Battlegear 2, provides a dual-wielding mechanic that can allow a player to have a pickaxe in one hand, and a torch in the other... and the player won't even need to keep their main slots occupied for this.  The mod also adds shields, a quiver to hold up to four stacks of arrows, and different types of ammunition to give the player some level of control over the amount and kind of damage they do.  Just be aware that archery-capable mobs will also be able to use custom arrows as well.

One thing to keep in mind is that Inventory Tweaks auto-replacement needs to be disabled if using Battlegear.  Otherwise, the moment it tries to autoreplace a broken tool in a MB slot, the game will crash.

The other mod, a way to replace the need for Battlegear, or the requirement to spend experience to gain right-click placement, is TorchTools, which gives the mechanic by default, exactly the same way that Tinker's Construct provides it.

### Server vs. Client

The mods in here can be split into "Client" and "Server."  This is because some mods will be using code that only works in a client; servers calling this code will crash.  I'll leave the decision of which mods to place in what folder an exercise to the modpacker.

# Industrial Age

Once you have the ability to mine and process iron, the self-powered machine becomes a reality.  Well, there are redstone devices, but this makes them look like block and tackle by comparison.

## Railway

Ah, the self-powered, rail-directed transport system.  By far, the cheapest long-distance transport mechanic for the player with a mining operation in one biome, a forestry operation in another biome, a fishery in a third, and several farms providing food in a forth.  With RailCraft, the vanilla minecart system is expanded into a full-on train set, with locomotives that can carry a long line of linked minecarts to collect and distribute materials to various locations, and even have extensive detection and control systems to allow complex routing assignments.

Another useful feature to Railcraft is the tank.  It has the ability to make enormous tanks that can store liquids for later use.  The capacity of a Railcraft tank is twice the capacity of a similarly-sized OpenBlocks tank, but half that of similar-sized RotaryCraft reservoirs (although this tank looks *so* much better than the reservoirs).

## Shaft Power

The railway is a good way to transport items long distances, but the process of automating things in the short-range is still an important ability.  As the central tech mod in this modpack, RotaryCraft contains automation tools for just about every possible task in the game, from mining, to processing, to farming, to forestry, and on and on.  This mod also allows for longer-distance power transmission using chain drives and chain links.  RotaryCraft and ReactorCraft are the only mods in the game with their power generation enabled; every other mod has their engines/generators/etc. disabled.  Considering the comparison of power levels, this really isn't a loss.  The main challenge with these mods is intellectual; the mechanics to the mods are semi-realistic.  You won't need to know any in-depth engineering calculations, but some basic understanding of multiplication and division will be necessary to make use of the energy system's twin values (speed*torque=power) in this mod.

In addition to the shaft power provided by RotaryCraft and ReactorCraft, a means of electrical storage and transmission is available in the form of ElectriCraft.  In the same way that RotaryCraft handles shaft power (semi-realistically), electricraft handles its energy (current*force=power) in an identical way.  In fact, in the conversion, speed becomes current (rad/s -> amps), while torque becomes force (nm -> volts).  In both cases, the power is measured in Watts.

These mods all come with a handbook, explaining the way the power works.  Additionally, players who get the hang of the mods realizes one incredible fact: if the torque is enough to power a machine, then adding shaft speed will *always* make the machine faster.  Just to make sure you understand this:  *There is no upper limit to RotaryCraft machine speeds!*  Soon enough, the machine's output will be measured in units per second, rather than seconds per unit.  The exception is in heat-based machines, where the torque and speed should be identical for the best results... in which case, it's simply more power that increases performance.

Now, in those cases where Redstone Flux is needed (and there are still quite a few machines that use it; see the next few sections), RotaryCraft has converters for those mods.  It even has converters to provide RailCraft steam, so there's no need to make Railcraft boilers for Railcraft steam.

## Redstone Flux

RotaryCraft can cover an enormous ground where features are concerned.  However, it does not have everything there is.  For those things that it does not duplicate, mods have been added to compensate for that lack.

BuildCraft has two major purposes in this modpack.  The first purpose is for construction; the filler, builder, and architect table have been enabled for the player's use.  Base construction has never been faster.

The other purpose for Buildcraft is to handle the creation of fossil fuels.  Buildcraft spawns oil fields all over the world, and provides the pump and refinery to convert all that oil into buildcraft fuel, which is essentially gasoline.  You can then use that fuel in the RotaryCraft Fuel-powered engine to provide power, or save it and use it in a Fuel Enhancer with some other ingredients to turn buildcraft fuel into jet fuel.  Needless to say, the jet fuel's more powerful.

For the bee people out there, Forestry is also included in the pack.  In order to keep RotaryCraft relevant, the farming module is disabled.  However, the factory module is still active.  In this way, bees and their products can still be processed.

Redstone tech can provide a good level of automation, but there are limits to what it can do on a small scale, even with Project Red miniaturizations.  And it can only send one signal per line (a 16-value scale, admittedly, but still, just one signal).  OpenComputers provides a much higher level of control to automation, with the ability to sense the states of machines, and send redstone signals where the player needs them to go, using lua as a full-on programming language.

## Miscellaneous

JourneyMap is a heavy program.  Some peoples' computers simply cannot handle it.  For this reason, Antique Atlas has been included.  While BiblioCraft includes an atlas, it uses vanilla maps, which are localized.  Antique Atlas produces a larger-scaled map that includes multi-chunk biome identification and the ability to mark points of interest.

Another tool used in the aim of mitigating the no-longer-present Tinker's Construct is Enchanting Plus.  This mod is used as a way to replace the TiC modifiers.  By default, enchanting is a hit-or-miss proposition, whereas modifiers allowed a player to put a specific ability on their tool at the desired level.  Enchanting Plus allows a player to pick the type and degree of enchantments that can be put on their tool in the same way, thereby replacing the effect of modifiers.

Sorting through inventories can be a frustrating exercise; Inventory Tweaks provides in-chest sorting, but what if multiple chests have the same item?  How does one sort everything in a whole room of chests?  Refined Relocation can be used as a way to filter a group of chests, so that placing items in any of them will allow them to be moved to the correct chest automatically.

# Mad Science

The name is mainly to be funny, but ultimately, this stage is the "high science" game... just the sort of thing that a soon-to-be world ruler will need.

To begin with, no mad scientist is *ever* going to operate using responsible power generation.  Not when the nuclear option is on the table.  While it was described in the industrial stage, and it isn't materially-gated like the other mods in this section, you're not likely going to be able to make your first fission reactor until well after the point where you're able to make the other mad science tech.

Onto genetics.  What is mad science without the genetic abominations?  Advanced Genetics allows a player to analyze the genetics of various creatures, isolate the genes that provide the creatures' powers, and then insert it into other creatures... or even themselves!

So far, there is a time-consuming need to breed bees and hope they produce a specific strain.  With Gendustry, the player can control the bees.  The bees can produce what the scientist needs, or they can be melted down for their genetic material.

Next, any respectable mad scientist will have ways of storing things that keeps them out of the way until they're needed, and the more techy, the better.  Why not keep everything as energy?  Applied Energistics and Extra Cells provides a sufficiently sciency way of storing things in large quantities without the need for bulky containers or complex sorting systems!  And with AE2 Stuff, there's no longer a need to keep water pits around the base to grow pure crystals.

Speaking of storing stuff, some things are just useless.  So, what mad scientist would pass up an opportunity to break those things down into their constituent atoms or molecules, and just make what they need, right?  Mad chemistry comes alive with the Minechem mod.

By now, you might have noticed veins of fossilized bones and plants.  This is because no real mad scientist would be completel without a dinosaur army to rule the world with.  With the Fossils and Archaeology Revival mod, you can get one!

Finally, at the far end of mad science, there's the power to control time and space.  While viable time control isn't really in the pack at this time, the option is reserved for future updates.  However, space is already handled in two forms.

First, there is the Enhanced Portals mod.  This mod's purpose is to allow instantaneous transport between two points in space.  ANY space.  Any dimension.  With this mod, you can make a portal to the Nether or the End that can be controlled by you.  You can also use these portals to transmit items and fluids between locations as well.

Redstone Flux can be transmitted as well, but not shaft power; this is one of the few times where the use of rotational dynamos and magnetostatics will need to be used to transport shaft power using the portal, and even then, power loss can be expected in the process, due to the loss of power using Magnetostatics.

The mod that provides the ultimate control over space and time is RFTools.  This mod adds a lot of features that control how redstone flux networks operate, but its most powerful feature is the ability to *create universes*.  What mad scientist in his right mind (*ahem*) would miss out on being able to make his own universe, and preside over it like unto a god?

It just makes you want to laugh.  Wildly.

## Clarification

I use "Mad Science" as a schtick, because the "scientific" mods over-simplify the sciences they are designed to emulate.  Matter/Energy conversion is nowhere near as cheap a process as Applied Energistics attempts to demonstrate.  Genetic sequencing is far more complex than simply pulling some skin cells, analyzing the cells, and giving a person an injection to allow them the power of flight, or teleportation.  Chemistry requires a lot of math, because you can only convert molecules in groups, so as to allow the atoms to re-bond to different structures (and in some cases, you need a catalyst to even get the process rolling in the first place).  De-extinction is, in fact, a thing, but so far, nobody's been able to de-extinct a species enough for it to become self-supporting yet.  And teleportation pretty much has the same problem as matter/energy conversion; it is not cheap to perform, power-wise.

# Ender Tech

Beyond mad science, there is *Alien Science*, or, in this game, *Ender Tech*.  In short, this is where technology is dependent on the alien materials from the Ender dimension that appear in this world through its agents: the endermen.  In this pack, ender tech has been altered (using MineTweaker scripts) to require plutonium-infused ender pearls, known as the "Cherenkov Singularity," to craft ender tech.

I can probably provide some form of technobabble to explain the mystery behind the Cherenkov Singularity; perhaps the plutonium gives the pearl a way to interface with newtonian particles, so that the pearl can be used inside of machines, instead of being completely isolated from reality.  Maybe the radiation released by the plutonium is warped enough by the pearl that the resulting energy can allow technology to replicate the effects of the pearl.  Maybe the pearl exists in a stable quantum indeterminate state, and the energy released by the plutonium produces a continuously-collapsing state that allows for constant entanglement between items.

Regardless of what explanation makes the most sense to you, the idea is that plutonium infusion allows machines to use the ender pearl in a way that is controllable without destroying the pearl itself, or requiring the interaction of a living being.  And a couple mods provide ways to construct machines that use ender power in their functions.

While it provides a major grab-bag of non-ender machines for the discerning player (which the player does not need to wait for ender-tech to use), Extra Utilities includes a good number of components that are clearly ender-tech, for example, the Ender-Thermic Pump and the Ender Quarry.  These machines use the inherent teleportation mechanic of ender pearls to make things happen.

There is a major problem with the default configuration for this mod, however, and that is the QED; some things are enforced to use the QED to be made, and the QED is gated behind blocks that are gated behind the singularity.  I could have recreated the recipes in Minetweaker, and removed them from the QED, but I don't see the point to it in the first place, so it was simply disabled.

# The End

Finally, getting to the end.  For this to happen, I wanted to make sure that the End was gated behind both ReactorCraft and Invasion, so the first thing that was done was the removal of End Portal Stones using Custom Ore Generation.  The second task was to make a recipe for an End Portal stone for the player to make and place on their own.  This recipe includes 8 Cherenkov Singularities (it's not cheap), as well as one rift flux in the center (the player gets *one* rift flux for each invasion successfully fended off).  Once the player has 96 Cherenkov Singularities and 12 rift flux, they can make the 12 end portal stones needed to actually make an end portal, and visit the End to fight the dragon.

Simply put, you don't get to end the game until you get to the end of the game.

# Conclusion

Well, here's the full measure of the modpack.  The reasons and intents, as well as what the mods do.  I'm aware it's a little thin in places, so anyone who has questions can feel free to ask, and I will update the recipe as I can.  This recipe is current as of version 1.4.0.
