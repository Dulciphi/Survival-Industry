Cherenkov radiation, also known as Vavilovâ€“Cherenkov radiation,[a] is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium.

A dielectric material (dielectric for short) is an electrical insulator that can be polarized by an applied electric field. When a dielectric is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in a conductor, but only slightly shift from their average equilibrium positions causing dielectric polarization.

Ender pearl is a pearl filled with raw ender, which is considered to be a liquid by the Vegan Option.  Can raw ender be a dielectric material?  If so, the radiation from plutonium could stimulate Cherenkov radiation, possibly resulting in a pure blue glow from an ender pearl, likely centering around the plutonium pellet.  
	* Green glow?  Classic radiation color.
		Naah, WP search for cherenkov always shows shades of blue.

This can be used in place of the Ender Pearl in "ender tech".

* Ender Tools mod could be a good source of ender tech to fill out the ender tech tree.
* Ender Portal---NO, needs player to be committed to finishing game.  Check to see if portals can be made.
	* yes, can be made.  Check to see if existing portal stones can be removed to prevent premature end game.
		* Configuration made, still needs testing.

No, ender portal should stay with the flux rift requirement.

Ender tech:
* Any machine or furniture with "Ender" in the name.
* Any instant transport technology.

Enhanced Portals 3... ender tech?  Maybe.  Need to check for balance.
	Probably.  Will have to check for possible balance issues.

RFTools dimension tech?  Likely.  Also need to chekc balance.
